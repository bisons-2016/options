## Simple Line Graph
Plot a simple line graph that shows the projection of the Squares function.

> f(x) = x^2

The x-axis should range from 0 to 20, whereas the y-axis should have the values of f(x). Your code would need to implement the squares function and run it through the input values of 0 - 20, and then plot this out in the form of a red dashed line graph. Your graph must label the x-axis as "Input" and the y-axis as "Squares" and must show the title as "Squares"


## Multiple Line Series
Expand on the previous problem to draw a graph that plots out separate line series as per the following functions.

> * Linear function: f(x) = 3 + 2x
> * Square function: f(x) = x^2
> * Cube function: f(x) = x^3

Your graph must plot each function as a solid line (in the color of your choice), along with a legend for each line series. As with the previous problem the values of x should range from 0 - 20


## Pie
Plot a pie chart that will visually represent the results of the Republican caucuses in Iowa. The results have been calculated and stored in a dictionary which has been included in the Grapher.py file. Your task is render a pie chart with the slices of the pie set according to the values in the dictionary and the labels of each slice set to the keys in the dictionary. Additionally, your pie needs to show Trump's slice broken out.
